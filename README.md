# djungelskog
Tensorflow Hello World -- What tile is djungelskog on?

We follow a [Tensorflow Tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification) to detect where [djungelskog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djungelskog) is sitting.  Don't let Derpy fool you.

The images directory has 5 subdirectory.  Subdirectory 0 has no djungelskogs.  The other 4 contain our friend in one of four tiles.

If you have tensorflow installed in your python implementation.

```
$ python3 train.py
```

# Install Tensorflow

While is it possible to
```
$ pip install tensorflow-cpu
```
I would suggest against it.  Tensorflow installs and in some cases down grades other packages.  Instead follow the instructions to create a python/conda environment for tensorflow.

[Tensorflow Install](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)

[Tensorflow Pip Install](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip)

Windows 11 note: you may need to enable long path name support.
