Tensorflow Hello World -- What tile is djungelskog on?

We follow a [Tensorflow Tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification) to detect where [djungelskog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djungelskog) is sitting.  Don't let Derpy fool you.

The images directory has 5 subdirectory.  Subdirectory 0 has no djungelskogs.  The other 4 contain our friend in one of four tiles.

If you have tensorflow installed in your python implementation.
